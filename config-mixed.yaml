# Explicit rows with column spanning
layout:
  rows:
    # Row 1: Three single columns
    - widgets: [cpu, memory, disk]

    # Row 2: docker spans 2 cols, leaving room for 1 widget
    - widgets: [docker, services]

    # Row 3: processes takes most of the row
    - widgets: [processes]

    # Row 4: Single widget takes full row by default
    - widgets: [logs]
