# Default refresh interval (seconds) for all widgets
default_refresh: 5

# Widget definitions
widgets:
  # Example 1: Slower refresh in expanded view (reduce resource usage)
  alerts:
    path: alerts.sh
    refresh: 30             # Main dashboard: moderate updates
    expanded_refresh: 60    # Expanded dialog: slower (alerts change infrequently)
    pinned: false
    # Optional: SHA256 checksum for security validation
    # sha256: abc123...

  # Example 2: Real-time monitoring (keep same rate in both views)
  cpu:
    path: cpu.sh
    refresh: 2
    # No expanded_refresh - keep real-time in both views
    pinned: false
    # Optional: Specify where to search for widget
    # location: bundled  # bundled, custom, or auto (default)

  memory:
    path: memory.py
    refresh: 2
    # No expanded_refresh - real-time monitoring
    pinned: false

  # Example 3: Faster refresh in expanded view (detailed monitoring)
  disk:
    path: disk.sh
    refresh: 10             # Main dashboard: slower updates
    expanded_refresh: 5     # Expanded dialog: faster when viewing details
    pinned: false

  # Example 4: Very slow refresh (same for both views)
  updates:
    path: updates.sh
    refresh: 3600  # Check every hour
    # No expanded_refresh - hourly is appropriate for both views
    pinned: false

# Layout configuration
layout:
  # Simple list layout (responsive columns based on terminal width)
  order:
    - alerts      # System health monitoring (first for visibility)
    - cpu
    - memory
    - disk
    - updates     # Package updates

  # Alternative: Explicit grid layout (advanced)
  # rows:
  #   - widgets: [alerts, cpu, memory]
  #   - widgets: [disk, updates]

# Optional: Custom breakpoints for responsive layout
breakpoints:
  double: 100  # 100+ cols: 2 columns
  triple: 160  # 160+ cols: 3 columns
  quad: 220    # 220+ cols: 4 columns
